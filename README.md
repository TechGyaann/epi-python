Taking notes as I read through Elements of Programming Interviews in Python by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash.

# Revisiting

I was working through this pretty intensely around Oct - Dec 2018 to prep for my career change into programming. It's a good book! Some of the problems are a little funky since the book was originally written in C++, but the concepts it goes over are really good. 

I'd say this book was a great experience on how to persevere when feeling very clueless. Going from next to no programming experience to working through linked lists in this book felt very difficult, but I was making progress daily when I sat down to think, diagram, and code. 

It's been more than a year now since my career change and I'm inordinately satisfied with how things have turned out.
