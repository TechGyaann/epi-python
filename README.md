Taking notes as I read through Elements of Programming Interviews in Python by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash.

# Revisiting

I was working through this pretty intensely around Oct - Dec 2018 to prep for my career change into programming. It's a good book! Some of the problems are a little funky since the book was originally written in C++, but the concepts it goes over are really good. 

It's now September 2019 (wow, time flies) and I thought it'd be good for me to come back to this. It's quality stuff. Highly recommend this book!
